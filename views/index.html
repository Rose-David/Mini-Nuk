      <h2>Oh hi,</h2>

      <p>
        I don't really know how you got here, but this is just where my discord
        bot lives.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know why exactly you're here, but I guess while you're here you
        can submit a feature or something.
      </p>
      <p>
        IDK, none of these actually get sent to me, they just get deleted when you leave. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
      </p>
